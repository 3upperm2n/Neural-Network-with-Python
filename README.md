----- 3 Layer Neural Network
For Siraj Raval's YouTube challenge of the week.

This is a neural network with 3 layers (2 hidden), made using just numpy. It's an extended version of Siraj's code which had just one layer.

Here is a pictorial illustration:

#### Note:
This is a very simple neural network, without an activation function. Without a non-linear activation function, the neural network behaves just like a linear function, no different to a single-layer perceptron.
